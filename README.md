# Sales-project
Hello Everyone here is my project which is on domain 'DATA ANALISYS'.
This project focuses on the analysis of Diwali sales data, aiming to identify key trends, customer preferences, and sales patterns during the festive season. Using advanced data analytics techniques, I have processed and visualized a large dataset to uncover valuable insights that can drive business strategies and improve decision-making. The analysis covers various dimensions such as product categories, customer demographics, and regional sales performance. This repository contains the data, code, and detailed documentation to replicate the analysis and explore the findings.
THANK YOUüôè.
